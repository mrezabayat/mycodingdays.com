Hi there! I’m a Senior C++ Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience in software development, specializing in low-latency systems, high-performance computing, and video compression technologies. Based in the UK, I have had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects that push the boundaries of both software engineering and computational efficiency.

My career began with a strong foundation in mechanical engineering, but my passion for technology and software development led me to focus on C++ programming. Over the years, I've honed my skills in low-level programming, system optimization, and parallel computing, with a particular focus on solving complex problems related to video encoding, decoding, and streaming. My work at V-Nova, for example, involved integrating the LCEVC codec into both iOS and embedded systems, where I contributed to performance optimization and developed cross-compilation solutions to run on diverse platforms like Jetson TX2 and Xavier. These projects gave me invaluable experience in managing performance trade-offs and achieving real-time performance for demanding applications.

In addition to my work on video compression, I have an extensive background in software architecture and system design. I am particularly adept at applying design patterns and the principles of modern C++ (C++17/C++20) to create maintainable, efficient, and scalable systems. I take pride in writing clean, modular code and adopting best practices in concurrency, testing, and continuous integration. My deep understanding of tools like FFmpeg, GStreamer, and GoogleTest allows me to build and optimize video processing pipelines, ensuring high-quality output while minimizing resource consumption.

As an engineer, I am constantly driven by the need for optimization and innovation. I thrive in environments that demand precision and creativity, where I can leverage my expertise to make systems faster, more reliable, and more efficient. From reducing latency in video streaming to optimizing system performance for high-frequency trading applications, I am always looking for the next challenge that will push me to refine my skills and make a meaningful impact.

Outside of work, I am a lifelong learner with a keen interest in web development and machine learning. I spend my free time reading up on the latest advancements in software engineering, working on personal projects, and engaging in activities like swimming and chess. I also enjoy mentoring aspiring engineers and sharing knowledge, which is why I’m building a website dedicated to teaching C++ programming interactively through real-world design patterns and object-oriented principles.

Whether I’m developing for Linux, Mac, or Windows, my goal is to always deliver high-quality software that meets the most stringent performance requirements. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am always looking to collaborate with like-minded professionals to solve the most complex engineering problems.
